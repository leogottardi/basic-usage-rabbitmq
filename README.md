## ðŸ““ Get started

> make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed to start the rabbitmq service

Use the command below to start rabbitmq on port 15672:

```
// start the container in background
$ docker-compose up -d
```

With the service started, access the rabbitmq interface and create an exchange and a queue with the following names:

```
Exchange: test-exchange
Queue: test-queue
```

Now everything is set up for the project to run.

Open 2 terminal tabs, one for the publisher and one for the consumer.

On the publisher tab, write the message to be sent to the exchange.

In the consumer tab, see the messages
